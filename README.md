# export_qbittorrent_info
The DOS script aims to export basic information related to files downloaded using qBittorrent on a windows machine.
It looks for the download path of the file upon completion, and creates a .json file with details like:
  torrent name,
  torrent hash,
  total size,
  files list, their size and extension
